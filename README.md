# Regulatory-Compliance-Checker-for-Legal-Contracts-with-leveraging-AI
The Regulatory Compliance Checker is an AI-powered system designed to analyze legal contracts and assess their compliance with applicable regulations and standards. Here, we are using the approach is RAG approach.
The project "Regulatory Compliance Checker for Legal Contracts" leveraging AI focuses on automating the review and analysis of legal contracts to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
**Key Components of the Compliance Checker**
         **Key Clause Extraction**:
             Use NLP techniques to identify and extract key clauses from legal contracts. This includes clauses related to confidentiality, indemnification, 
              termination, etc.
         **Contract Analysis Score:**
           Implement a scoring system that evaluates the contract based on predefined criteria. The score can reflect the quality of the clauses, compliance with 
             regulations, and risk levels associated with specific terms.
        **Contract Type Identification:**
         Determine the type of contract (e.g., service agreement, lease, partnership) based on its content and structure. This can help tailor the analysis and 
            scoring criteria.
**  Overview**
The Regulatory Compliance Checker for Legal Contracts is an innovative project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the review and analysis of legal contracts. This tool aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of contract management processes by identifying key clauses, assessing compliance with relevant regulations, and providing actionable insights for legal professionals.
Objectives
**Automated Contract Review:** The primary goal is to streamline the contract review process, allowing legal teams to analyze contracts significantly faster than traditional manual methods.
**Key Clause Extraction**: The system extracts critical clauses from contracts, such as confidentiality, indemnification, termination, and payment terms, enabling users to focus on essential elements.
**Compliance Assessment**: By leveraging AI algorithms, the tool evaluates contracts against predefined regulatory standards and internal guidelines to ensure compliance.
**Risk Identification:** The application identifies potential legal risks associated with specific clauses, providing recommendations for mitigation.
Features
**AI-Powered Clause Extraction:**
Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract and categorize key clauses from uploaded contracts.
Reduces the time and effort required for manual clause identification.
**Contract Analysis Score:**
Calculates a contract analysis score based on the presence and quality of key clauses.
Provides a percentage score that reflects the overall compliance and risk level of the contract.
**Contract Type Identification:**
Automatically identifies the type of contract (e.g., lease agreement, service agreement) based on its content.
Tailors analysis criteria according to the identified contract type.
**User-Friendly Interface:**
Built using Streamlit, the application features an intuitive interface that allows users to upload documents easily and view results in real-time.
Displays extracted clauses in a clear bullet-point format for easy readability.
**Sidebar Functionality:**
A sidebar includes a submit button for processing uploaded files, enhancing user interaction.
Success messages inform users when files are uploaded and data is saved successfully.
**Benefits**
**Efficiency Gains:** Automating the contract review process allows legal teams to focus on strategic tasks rather than manual document analysis.
**Enhanced Accuracy**: AI-driven recommendations help ensure that contracts meet regulatory standards and internal policies, minimizing errors.
**Improved Risk Management:** By identifying potential risks early in the review process, organizations can take proactive measures to mitigate legal exposure.
